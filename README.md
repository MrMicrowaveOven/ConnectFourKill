# Connect Four Kill!

Hello!  Do you love Connect Four?  How about a game where you will LOSE every time.  Ready to have your childhood game ruined?

## Plan

Make a game with human players first (most likely front-end JS, maybe even React.js, ANGULAR maybe?), or maybe even a random (1-7) computer player.  THEN switch the computerTurn() function to computerKillTurn() once the algorithm is programmed in.

HTML Grid with circles inside will be a good UI.
